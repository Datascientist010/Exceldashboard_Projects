Portfolio Project -I

This Project convey about How's the E-commerce Logistics Eco-System Drives and perform operation the Operation at different Levels
to reflect these things we can use the KPI which Drive the Business and Overall structure we Divided into 4 Parts :- Quantity, Quality, 
Time , Cost which are the pillar of any business.

Let elaborate a Little from an Ocean

Quantity: This Point speaks about the all the KPI's which we take it as overall business parameters like e.g : How much Shipments 
we received in month , from that how many shipments will be Delivered, or How many shipments lost or Undelivered these are all the 
part of Quantity and KPI Terms.

Quality: This Point speaks about in simple business terms we can all it Conversion ratio or Conversion % for an e.g Let's say if we 
received 1000 Shipments and Out of we Delivered 700 Shipments means Our Conversion ratio is 70% or any Business or marketing 
Plan will be build upon Conversion Assumptions so, its a very vital part of any business to Predict the things in future e.g we grow @ 
10% or we capture 10% market share like that kind of terminology.

Time : As this Point speaks itself like In how much time we achieved those results Because once the time is passes there is 
no meaning of winning or Losing the game.

Cost : In business cash is like a blood in business terms because if the certain cost parameters are above the certain limit for e.g 
like if there is company if the says like they are generating a business from the but on other hand Expanse ratio are 20% of revenue or 
we cannot say an ideal position for business for a long Term For E.g I have recently gone threw case study of Mama Earth its got to 
know very interesting fact that when they Pump up the capital for marketing Expenditure then there sales Boom else it's normal so, 
the simple message says work on your Quality not any marketing game because ideal consumer goods marketing expenditure will be 
reduced year on year basis so, the data speaks more then the Numbers.
